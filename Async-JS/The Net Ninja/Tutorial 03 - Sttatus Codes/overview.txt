Status Codes
- The result code 200 means that the page the client wanted is available and shown in the content. 
- The result code 404 means that the page the client wanted is not available, but it can also return content (eg. a page saying "sorry, couldn't find your page")
- Usually a normal web page returns 200, saying all is ok.
