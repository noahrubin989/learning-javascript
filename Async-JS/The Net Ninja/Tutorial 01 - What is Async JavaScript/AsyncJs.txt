What is Async JavaScript?
- Governs how we perform tasks which take some time to complete (e.g. Getting data from a database)
- Main idea: Start something now and finish later

Synchronous JavaScript:
- JavaScript can run ONE statement at a time. 
- Here line one is run, then once that is done line two is run, then line three is run after that:
- "Single Threaded"
```
console.log('line 1');
console.log('line 2');
console.log('line 3');
```
With synchronous code, the problem arises when a single statement (or 2+) starts really blocking things up:
```
doQuickCheck();
runSimpleTask();
getLoadsOfData();  // could take very long!
processData();     // could take very long!
doQuickCheck();
runSimpleTask();
```

Async code is the solutions:
