Brainstorm of useful Bootstrap implementation ideas for QR code generator:

Card
- Use a Bootstrap card component to provide a container for the QR code generator. 
- The card can hold the necessary input fields and button to "Generate Code"

Collapse
- Maybe use this for displaying the generated QR code

Form controls
- Bootstrap offers a wide range of form control styles that you can use for input fields, such as text inputs for entering data that will be encoded into the QR code.

Alerts
- Display success or error messages when generating or interacting with the QR code generator.
- Unable to generate code, etc.
